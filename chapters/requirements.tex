\chapter{REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATION}
\label{chap:requirements}

% GradeCalc aims to be the first choice of students. To be in that precious spot, it will have to fit the student's needs perfectly. The following ones are the requirements I collected from asking colleagues and filtering brainstormed ideas.

This section defines and explains the requirements of the application. They are obtained by analyzing how students manage their grades and coming up with solutions that would help them be more productive. They are also obtained by directly asking what potential users would want in the app.
